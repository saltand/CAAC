# CAAC React Stories

This Storybook documents the React version of the CAAC cat image component.

- Toggle controls to explore props such as `width`, `height`, and `style`.
- Stories use a mocked Cat API response, so images work offline.
- The component mirrors the published package at `@caac/react`.

Use the navigation panel to switch between the documentation and the interactive examples.
